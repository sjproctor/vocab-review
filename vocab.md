# Vocab Review

### Git and GitHub

- git - local, software
- GitHub - remote, platform
- repositories - directory for projects on GitHub
- version control - the labeling of each change of code in git
- branch - temporary pathway
- main branch - source of truth
- local - your computer
- remote - online, GitHub
- checkout - moving between branches
- staging - git add
- commit - the label gets added for the version change, hash for computer, message for humans
- merging - adding new code to the source of truth
- stale branch - merging is done, branches that need to be deleted are stale

### JavaScript

- JavaScript - coding language, dynamic (dynamically typed), logic language
- data types - predefined categories of information
- primitive data type - most broken down data types
- composite data type - array, collection
- number - data types that can perform math
- float - decimal number
- modulo operator - whole number remainder %
- string - collection of characters
- concatenation - combining strings or arrays
- Boolean - true/false 
- undefined - variable with no value
- null - equal to nothing else
- symbol - unique identifier
- type coercion - 8 == '8' JavaScript can change types to make evaluations
- variable - named stored info
- variable declaration - var (global scope), let (local scope), const (cannot be reassigned)
- camelCase - naming convention for JavaScript
- assignment operator - = 
- index - position within a string or array, zero-index
- build-in method - shortcuts, makes coding easier and more clearly communicated
- argument - [].push('yo'), passing information into a built in method

### Conditionals

- equality operator === evaluating the equality of two things on either side of the === and will return boolean
- loose equality operator - ==, evaluation of equality that allows for type coersion
- strict equality operator - ===, no type coersion
- relational operator - < > <= >= numbers, boolean
- logical operator - && || allows for chaining operations to get a single output
- bang operator - ! negates
- conditional statement - if/else, decision trees, evaluation
- if - if(){} - protected word in JavaScript
- else - catchall
- string interpolation - inject variables into a string ``${}``
